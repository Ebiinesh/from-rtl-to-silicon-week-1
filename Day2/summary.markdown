| **Timing Libraries**      | Decode .lib files for cell timing/power; choose variants for density vs. speed. | Mix small cells for power savings, big ones for hot paths—like a balanced meal! |
| **Synthesis Strategies**  | Hierarchical for modularity; flat for optimization; submodule for big projects. | Start hierarchical, flatten at the end: it's like sketching rough, then polishing the sculpture. |
| **Flip-Flop Coding**      | Use async/syn resets to block glitches; always initialize to avoid chaos.     | Code flops like safety nets—async for quick escapes, sync for clock dances. |
| **Overall Impact**        | Build glitch-free, scalable circuits with Yosys commands and library smarts.  | Tinker boldly: one command tweak could shave 20% power—your innovation playground! |
